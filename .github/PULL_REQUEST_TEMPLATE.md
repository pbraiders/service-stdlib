Tips:

I didn't stick to the conventional commit guidelines:

**I only have 1 commit**
To reword the last commit, we can make use of git's --amend switch to add something to our latest commit (code, changes, rewording). Use the following commands to rephrase the last commit and get that change merged!
```bash
git commit --amend -m "feat: new feature"
git push --force
```

**I added more than commit**
If all of your commits need to go to main because it makes sense to treat these as atomic units, you can use git's interactive rebase functionality to reword any commit between main and your HEAD.
To start an interactive rebase, type `git rebase -i main`.

This will open your $EDITOR and you can mark the commits you want to reword with reword (or) rather than pick. Exiting that file will start the rebase and spwan your $EDITOR to alter the commit message for each commit you marked as reword.

Once done, use `git push --force` to bring the changes to the pull request.
